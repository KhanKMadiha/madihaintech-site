## Featured Project: AI Support Chatbot

This project documents the design and development of a conversational AI chatbot created as part of my AI learning journey.

The goal is to demonstrate how I approach conversational AI using a **support-engineering mindset**: clear user guidance, structured decision paths, and thoughtful handling of ambiguity.

### Background

I'm a Support Engineer with over 5 years of experience supporting SaaS products and high-touch clients. My background includes troubleshooting complex issues, handling escalations, improving workflows, and writing clear documentation.

After completing the IBM AI Fundamentals learning path, I discovered how closely conversational AI design mirrors the logic-building and testing work I've done in support roles.

This project represents my transition toward AI-focused support and operations roles.

### What This Project Includes

- A working conversational chatbot built using Dialogflow
- Documented conversation flows and decision trees
- Testing notes and iteration logs
- Ongoing refinements and improvements

### Why This Project Matters

Rather than focusing on heavy coding, this project highlights:
- **System thinking** – designing scalable conversation paths
- **User intent handling** – anticipating needs and routing appropriately
- **Clear communication** – crafting empathetic, helpful AI interactions
- **Applied experience** – translating real-world support patterns into AI systems

This reflects how I approach problem-solving in professional support environments.

### Project Status

✅ First working version of the chatbot built and tested using Dialogflow

**Current focus:**
- Refining responses and conversational tone
- Improving fallback handling
- Iterating based on testing notes
- Exploring integration patterns for support workflows
