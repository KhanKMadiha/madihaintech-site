    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Madiha 👋🏼<br /><br />
      I’m a Support Engineer with over five years of experience supporting SaaS products and high-touch Enterprise clients.
      I’m entirely self-taught and have built my technical foundation through a mix of hands-on problem solving,
      structured learning, and continuous exploration beyond day-to-day support work.
      <br /><br />
      I’ve leaned into complex problems throughout my career: debugging APIs, supporting SSO integrations,
      reproducing edge cases, and collaborating closely with engineering to resolve high-impact issues.
      What motivates me most is improving the systems around support — finding patterns, strengthening documentation,
      and making workflows more resilient.
      <br /><br />
      Lately, I’ve been exploring how AI can assist support teams, not by replacing human judgment,
      but by strengthening it through better context, tooling, and decision-making.
