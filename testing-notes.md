# AI Support Portfolio – Conversational Chatbot

This repository documents the design and development of a conversational AI chatbot created as part of my AI learning journey.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I approach conversational AI using a **support-engineering mindset**: clear user guidance, structured decision paths, and thoughtful handling of ambiguity.

## About Me

Hi, I’m Madiha Khan.

I’m a Support Engineer with over 5 years of experience supporting SaaS products and high-touch clients. My background includes troubleshooting complex issues, handling escalations, improving workflows, and writing clear documentation.

Recently, I completed the IBM AI Fundamentals learning path, where I discovered how closely conversational AI design mirrors the logic-building and testing work I’ve done in support roles.

This project represents my transition toward AI-focused support and operations roles.

## What This Project Will Include

This repository will evolve to include:

- A conversational chatbot designed as a portfolio assistant
- Documented conversation flows and decision trees
- Notes on testing, iteration, and refinement
- A live or embedded demo once the chatbot is built

## Why This Project Matters

Rather than focusing on heavy coding, this project highlights:
- System thinking
- User intent handling
- Clear communication in AI interactions
- Applying real-world support experience to AI systems

This reflects how I approach problem-solving in professional support environments.

## Project Status

🚧 **In progress** — currently designing conversation flows and logic before implementation.
